## How To Use

### Getting Started



### Prerequisites

RandomTalkPlugin assumes all the following prerequisites are met:

* XIVLauncher, FINAL FANTASY XIV, and Dalamud have all been installed and the game has been run with Dalamud at least once.
* XIVLauncher is installed to its default directories and configurations.
  * If a custom path is required for Dalamud's dev directory, it must be set with the `DALAMUD_HOME` environment variable.
* A .NET Core 8 SDK has been installed and configured, or is otherwise available. (In most cases, the IDE will take care of this.)
